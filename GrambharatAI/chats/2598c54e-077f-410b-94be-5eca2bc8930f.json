        "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that strives to create machines capable of performing tasks that would normally require human intelligence. These tasks include learning from data, recognizing patterns, making decisions, understanding natural language, and even generating creative content. AI systems typically rely on algorithms—especially machine learning models—that improve their performance as they process more information. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses layered neural networks that mimic the structure of the human brain to recognize complex patterns in images, speech, and text. Another AI approach, symbolic reasoning, uses logical rules to solve problems and make deductions. The practical applications of AI are vast: from virtual assistants and recommendation engines to autonomous vehicles and medical diagnostics. While AI can enhance productivity and insight, it also raises ethical concerns, such as privacy, bias, and the impact on employment. Researchers and developers continually refine AI techniques to balance efficiency, fairness, and accountability. As AI matures, it is expected to transform industries, reshape daily life, and redefine what it means to collaborate with machines.",
        "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines.  \nIt enables computers to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions.  \nMachine learning, a core AI technique, trains models on large datasets to improve performance over time.  \nDeep learning, using neural networks, excels at tasks like image and speech recognition.  \nAI systems can perform complex tasks such as playing chess, driving cars, or diagnosing diseases.  \nNatural language processing allows machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language.  \nReinforcement learning teaches agents to take actions that maximize cumulative reward.  \nDespite its power, AI relies on quality data and transparent algorithms to avoid bias.  \nEthical considerations emphasize accountability, privacy, and the societal impact of automation.  \nUltimately, AI augments human capabilities, offering new tools for problem‑solving and innovation.",
