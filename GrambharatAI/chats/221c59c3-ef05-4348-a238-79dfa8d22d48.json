      "content": "**Answer:**  \nNo – Ram Vilas is not eligible for a ₹10,000 loan at this time.\n\n**Why?**  \n- After adding the new EMI, his disposable income would drop to about ₹4,287.  \n- This leaves insufficient buffer (the loan would reduce his disposable income below what’s typically considered safe).  \n- The debt‑to‑income ratio would increase to 26.4 %, which is higher than the comfortable threshold.\n\n**What can help?**  \n1. **Increase income** – any additional earnings would boost his disposable income.  \n2. **Reduce the requested amount** – a smaller loan would lower the EMI.  \n3. **Reassess existing debts** – paying down the current ₹8,500 EMI would free up cash for the new loan.\n\nIf you can adjust any of these factors, you might improve his eligibility for a future loan.",

        "**Answer:**  \nRam Vilas is currently eligible for a maximum loan of **₹660,000**.\n\n### Why this amount?\n\n| Item | Value |\n|------|-------|\n| **Monthly income** | ₹33,000 |\n| **Existing EMI** | ₹8,500 |\n| **Disposable income after current EMI** | ₹4,500 |\n| **Debt‑to‑Income ratio** | 26.1 % (after adding a new loan) |\n| **Max allowable EMI** (based on typical 30 % threshold) | ≈ ₹10,000 |\n\n- The system caps the new EMI so that the total debt‑to‑income ratio stays below ~30 %.  \n- With a ₹660,000 loan at an assumed 12 % annual rate over 5 years, the monthly EMI would be roughly ₹12,000, which still leaves a manageable disposable income (~₹4,500‑₹5,000).\n\n### Recommendations to improve eligibility\n\n1. **Increase income** – any additional earnings will lower the debt‑to‑income ratio.  \n2. **Reduce existing liabilities** – paying down the ₹8,500 EMI will free up cash.  \n3. **Consider a longer repayment period** – extending the term can lower the monthly EMI.  \n4. **Use collateral** – if you have land or other assets, you may qualify for a higher amount or better rates.\n\nFeel free to let me know if you’d like to re‑calculate with different terms (interest rate, loan tenure, or a lower existing EMI), or if you want to explore collateral options.",
