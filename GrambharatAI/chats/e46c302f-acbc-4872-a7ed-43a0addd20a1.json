      "content": "**Short answer:**  \nNo, Phool Kumari is **not eligible** for a ₹10 lakh loan.\n\n---\n\n### Why?\n\n| Factor | Value | Limit / Recommendation |\n|--------|-------|------------------------|\n| **Debt‑to‑Income Ratio** | 85 % | Must be ≤ 60 % |\n| **Requested amount** | ₹10 ,00,000 | Maximum you could qualify for is ₹72,000 |\n| **Disposable income after EMIs** | ₹‑18,747 | You’re already short‑changing your income by almost ₹19 k each month |\n\n**Key take‑aways**\n\n- Your current liabilities (₹17,000 EMI) plus the projected new loan EMI (₹21,247) far exceed what your monthly income can comfortably support.\n- Even if the loan were approved, you’d have very little disposable income left, which would strain your finances and potentially jeopardise repayment.\n\n---\n\n### Next steps you might consider\n\n| Option | What it means | Suggested action |\n|--------|---------------|------------------|\n| **Pay off or refinance existing debt** | Reduces monthly EMI burden | Look into consolidating or renegotiating terms |\n| **Apply for a smaller loan** | Stay below the ₹72,000 cap | You could comfortably manage a loan of ₹50,000–₹60,000 |\n| **Increase income** | Improves debt‑to‑income ratio | Explore side income streams, upskilling, or business expansion |\n| **Use collateral** | Some lenders offer better terms with security | You own 2 acres of land; could be used as collateral to boost eligibility |\n\n---\n\n### Need more help?\n\n- Want to see what a smaller loan amount would look like?  \n- Curious about alternative financing options (e.g., micro‑credit, peer‑to‑peer lending)?  \n- Want advice on improving your credit score or income?\n\nJust let me know, and I can walk you through the next steps!",
