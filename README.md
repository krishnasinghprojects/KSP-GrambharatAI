### Grambharat AI  

### Offline Rural AI Ecosystem for Smart Assistance, Credit Assessment & Disaster Alerts  

## Overview  

**Grambharat AI** is a fully offline, edge-based AI ecosystem built for rural communities with limited or zero internet connectivity.  

It integrates three core components into a single decentralized gateway:

- 🌐 **Multilingual Smart Assistant**  
- 💳 **Alternative Credit Assessment Engine**  
- ⚠️ **Local Earthquake Detection & Alert System**  

All computation runs entirely on-device using open-source technologies.  

- No cloud dependency  
- No recurring API costs  
- No external data transmission  

This project was developed for the **InnVedX Code Hackathon – AI, Data & Smart Systems Track**.
